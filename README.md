  This create-ng4-semantic-ui (Angular 4 SemanticUI CLI) cli only generate the angular 4 application 
  with [SemanticUI](https://semantic-ui.com) and its main goal is to provide angular 4 semantic ui

  This cli is created on top of angular cli and so you are able to use angular cli commands after your 
  project is initialized or created.
